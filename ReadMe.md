Imports necessary classes and functions from Qiskit. QuantumCircuit for creating quantum circuits, Aer for simulation backends, execute to run the circuits, plot_histogram for visualization, and GroverOperator, ZGate for constructing Grovers Algorithm.
Grovers Algorithm Function

```python
def implement_grovers_algorithm(number_of_qubits, grover_oracle):
    grover_quantum_circuit = QuantumCircuit(number_of_qubits)
    grover_quantum_circuit.h(range(number_of_qubits))
    grover_operator = GroverOperator(grover_oracle, insert_barriers=True)
    optimal_iterations = round((3.14 / 4) * (2 ** (number_of_qubits / 2)))
    for _ in range(optimal_iterations):
        grover_quantum_circuit.append(grover_operator, range(number_of_qubits))
    grover_quantum_circuit.measure_all()
    return grover_quantum_circuit
```
Defines a function to implement Grover's Algorithm.
Initializes a quantum circuit and applies Hadamard gates to create a superposition.
GroverOperator is used to create the Grover iteration, including the oracle and diffuser.
The number of iterations is set to approximately the square root of the size of the search space.
The circuit is finalized by adding measurement to all qubits.
```python
def create_oracle_for_marked_state(target_marked_state):
    oracle_quantum_circuit = QuantumCircuit(len(target_marked_state))
    for qubit_index, bit_value in enumerate(target_marked_state):
        if bit_value == '0':
            oracle_quantum_circuit.x(qubit_index)
    oracle_quantum_circuit.append(ZGate().control(len(target_marked_state) - 1), range(len(target_marked_state)))
    for qubit_index, bit_value in enumerate(target_marked_state):
        if bit_value == '0':
            oracle_quantum_circuit.x(qubit_index)
    return oracle_quantum_circuit
```
Creates an oracle circuit for a specific marked state.
Uses Pauli-X gates to prepare the state and a controlled-Z gate to flip the phase of the marked state.
The final oracle flips the phase of only the marked state, leaving others unchanged.

Conclusion
The implementation of Grovers Algorithm in this repository demonstrates the use of quantum superposition and amplitude amplification to search an unsorted database more efficiently than classical algorithms. The code is structured to provide clarity and insight into the workings of one of the most fundamental algorithms in quantum computing.
